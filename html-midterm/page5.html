    <h1>Page One.html </h1>
    <p> * The first error I fixed was that in Line 22, the li element was missing a closing li tag, so I added that. </p>
    <p> * Similar to line 22, line 34 was missing a closing td tag, so I added that. </p>
    <p> * Line 40 was missing a closing tag for tr, so I added that at the end. </p>
    <p>* The h2 element was placed outside the table, so I moved the h2 closing element inside the table tags. </p>
    <p>* I was missing a characterset at the top of the page so I added that between the head, towards the header. </p>

    <h1>Page Two.html </h1>
    <p>* In line 51, the b tag is wrapped in the header tag, so it needs to be moved out so it is not wrapping it. </p>
    <p>* There is a broken link, and in order to fix it I added spaces, such as underscores. </p>
    <p>* On line 73, there was an hr tag, instead of an h6 closing tag, so I fixed it so that it would be a header instead of an hr tag. </p>
    <p>* The b tag on line 51 between the words 'Interior' weren't closed correctly so I had to fix that and the right tags for the formation. </p>

    <h1>Page Three.html </h1>
    <p> * In the head section, I added a title tag, opening and closing. </p>
    <p> * I added a link tag in order to link the cars.css document to the code itself. </p>
    <p> * The page was entirely midding the doctype header for html, so I had to add that to the top with an exclamation mark. </p>
    <p> * The meta was also missing so I had to add that. </p>
    <p> * I also had to add the lang tag as that was missing. </p>

    <h1>Page Four.html</h1>
    <p> * In the table section on line 28, a lot of the td tags were missing so I fixed those and added them where neccessary. </p>
    <p> * Line 1 was missing the docutype for the html, as well as page three, so I added that to the top. </p>
    <p> * A lot of the images were missing alternative tags for the pictures, so I added those. </p>
    <p> * A few of the image tags did not source the pictures correctly, such as writing "img/picturename" instead of "picturename" as the img part is completely unncessary. </p>
    <p> * Line 41 and Line 46 were missing the opening td tags so I added those as well. </p>
    <p> * Lines 33-35 2343 missing the td tags, so I had to fix those.
